[Figure3-KJ_em&th_power.R](Figure3-KJ_em&th_power.R) | Comparing the empirical and theoretical power of KJ statistic and generating Figure 3 in the manuscript. 
[Figure4-Sensitivity-Power.R](Figure4-Sensitivity-Power.R) | Comparing the power of AR and different KJ statistics and generating Figure 3 in the manuscript. 
[Figure5-Sensitivity-zeroinf-multitxt.R](Figure5-Sensitivity-zeroinf-multitxt.R) | Comparing the power of AR and different KJ statistics when the outcome is zero inflated and there are two treatment variables.  Generating Figure 3 in the manuscript.
